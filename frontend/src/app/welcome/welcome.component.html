        </p>
        <h2>The-Frigor-Method</h2>
        <p>
            Start with an easy habit that you already do. e.g. brushing your teeth in the morning <br><br>
            Pick a habit you want to adobt in your routine. For example exercise more. <br><br>
            Start with an amount you can easily do! Time AND Repetitions <br><br>
            The goal is not to do to much at a time. We want to build habits that last! <br><br>
            This process is called habit stacking.<br><br>
            <br><br>
            Another trick is to have your trigger be time or date based. For example: <br><br>
            Every wednesday when I come home from work and changed my chlothes I will pick 5 things to stash away.<br><br>
